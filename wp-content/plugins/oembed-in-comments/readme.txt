Stable tag: 1.1.2

WordPress supports oEmbed, but only in post content. This adds oEmbed support to comments.

== Description ==

[oEmbed](http://oembed.com/) is an easy way to embed media. It turns links into embedded content automatically. WordPress has supported it in posts for a while, but not in comments. This plugin uses the oEmbed support already in WordPress and adds it to comments.

== Installation ==

1. Unzip and upload the plugin to your plugins directory (\`/wp-content/plugins/\`).
1. Activate oEmbed in Comments through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
1. That's it. There's no settings page. If the plugin is active, it's adding oEmbed to your comments.

== Screenshots ==

1. I just posted a YouTube link in the comment and automatically got an embed, just like in the post.
